TODO List
=========

Application functions
---------------------
*	Add different internal and external file formats.
*	Allow for the aspect ratio of character font .  e.g. an 80x25 text mode pc font is tall and thin.

Misc
----
*	Create an installer.

Method
------
*	Could have a flag in the charset to say that is is the result of a swap, to make sure that characters don't get too far away from the original.
*	Could blend similar characters to make a second which is between the one to replace and its replacement.
*	If there are a number of characters to choose from at the end of findSimilarBlock, then randomly choose one of them, so as not to get a repeated block effect.
*	Allow for inverse characters on the Jupiter Ace.
